import { motion } from "framer-motion"

```

### motion is an object that provides a set of components and hooks for creating animations and transitions in React applications.

</br>

# motion 🌠

### 🟢 When we use `<motion.element>` we're indicating that we want to animate that specific `<element>`. Framer Motion then provides additional props and features to facilitate those animations, such as initial, animate, and exit, allowing for more powerful and customizable animations.

</br>

# Initial Prop 📥

### 🟡 The initial prop is used to define the initial state of an animated component before it enters the DOM, it specify how the element should appear when it first renders.

</br>

# Animate Prop 💫

### 🔵 The animate prop is used to create animations for a component. It lets you set target values for different CSS properties, making it easy to have smooth changes when the component's state updates.

</br>

# Exit Prop 📤

### 🔴 Exit prop is used to define the animation that occurs when a component is removed from the React tree. This is particularly useful for creating smooth transitions when elements are unmounted/removed, enhancing the user experience by visually indicating that something has disappeared.

</br>

# Scroll Triggered Animations 📜

### 🟣 These animations are triggered when the user scrolls to a specific point in the viewport. Once the scroll reaches that point, the animation plays.

</br>

## Use Cases 👉

### 🟢 Great for revealing elements, changing styles, or starting animations at specific sections of a page.

</br>

# Scroll Driven Animations 📜

### 🟠 These animations continuously change as the user scrolls, allowing for a smoother, more interactive experience. The animation properties can be mapped directly to the scroll position.

</br>

## Use Cases 👉

### 🟢 Ideal for parallax effects, transforming elements, or adjusting opacity based on scroll depth.
